## Global Web Page Scanner, say goodbye to hard coding and simplify automation testing

#PROBLEM

1.Every release, patch, and update that runs on the environments introduces a slew of changes, including automation maintenance to maintain these changes.

2.Current RPA tools on the market includes their own dashboard and scripting techniques and most of them do not have self healing mechanisms which means that if new components are added are previous one's are deleted the existing automation script fails since most of the components are hard coded. 

3.The existing automation is rendered obsolete, necessitating a fresh start. 

##SOLUTION

1.Our script will take screenshots of various web elements

2.Using a simple interface you can choose the web components you want to perform actions on and also specify the actions.(You can either choose to click a button or in case of text fields you can choose what should be written inside the text field)

3.Our script written using puppeteer will then perform all the tasks that you mentioned and perform seamless testing
